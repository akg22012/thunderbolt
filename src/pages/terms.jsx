                4.1 Our Website Package is made up of the following six
                Components:
              </h2>
              <p className="text-normal">
                a) A registered domain name: As part of our service, we
                purchase, manage, renew and host domains on our third-party
                servers on your behalf until the termination or expiry of our
                Contract with you. You will be the registered legal owner of the
                domain name. You may, at any time, transfer the domain name to
                an alternative hosting solution at no additional cost, providing
                that you have no outstanding debts to us. We are not responsible
                for any third party charges incurred by transferring a domain
                name to an alternative hosting solution. If you wish to change
                your domain name, we will need to register a new domain name at
                a current cost of £10 or €10 per domain name registered for one
                year from the date of registration. If you do not renew your
                Contract with us in accordance with Clause 5 following the
                expiry of the Initial Term, we will not pay any renewal fees in
                respect of that domain name and will allow the domain name to
                expire. We cannot guarantee the continued availability of a
                particular domain name if registration lapses. We are a Nominet
                registrar. For further information on domain names, please see
                Nominet’s terms and conditions available here:

                forwarders. E-mail forwarders are created, managed and renewed
                by us. E-mail forwarding services on your domain name are
                available only during the term of your Contract with us. We are
                not responsible for the content and material sent or received in

                own e-mails and your own email disclaimer(s); c) Full hosting
                and maintenance services: We will host your Website on third
                party servers. You acknowledge that hosting systems, servers and
                equipment may from time to time be inoperative or only partly
                operational as a consequence of mechanical breakdown,
                maintenance, hardware or software upgrades, telecommunication
                connectivity problems or other causes outside the control of us
                or our third party hosting service providers. In the event of
                any faults or issues that affect our ability to provide any part
                of the Website Package, we will, as soon as reasonably
                practicable: (i) notify you of the problem by e-mail; and (ii)
                arrange for the rectification of such faults or issues and the

                Conditions, we and our subsidiary and holding companies and
                affiliates will not be liable for any delay or failure to
                perform any obligations where the delay or failure results from
                any cause beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God,

                embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of
                terrorism, or war. d) Website creation and publication: Subject
                to receipt of the Website Content in accordance with Clause 7,
                we will build and publish your Website. We will send you a
                Congratulations E-mail to notify you of your Website’s
                publication; e) Listing of your Website: Your Website will be

                your Website is listed we are not responsible for its ongoing
                promotion. You acknowledge that the order in which websites are
                ranked in the natural search results is controlled by the search

                to make any guarantees about the success of any search engine
                promotion activity. f) Website Content changes: Once published,
                your Website will be treated by us as a fully functioning,
                completed work. However, you may make one change to the Website

                Content changes fair use policy as provided or made available to
                you from time to time. 4.2 We may offer you certain add-on
                products in addition to the Website Package. We shall notify you
                of the specific terms relating to such add-on products at the
                time at which they are offered, including price, payment,

                and, where we act as an intermediary in respect of third party

                or expenses of any kind due to the use of such third-party
